#ScriptWrapper
Authored by [Michael Ruschak](http://www.mikeruschak.com/). I wanted all my terminal logs to be saved to the same location. Similar to what Python Virtualenvwrapper does for projects. Found this little shell script invaluable during my college UNIX course. Also often find this little script useful when I need to create instructional blog posts or need a reference to debug later.

## Usage
Simply call `sh ScriptWrapper.sh` or add it as an executable in your UNIX path and call `ScriptWrapper`.

##Support
This is pretty much complete but if anyone has any suggestions please post to the issue tracker.
